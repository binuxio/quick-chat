#### Consideration

I made this project out of fun and for learning purposes. I got that idea because sometimes I needed to send some data from one device to another very quickly. And it was annoying and time-consuming to use Bluetooth, social media apps, or other known services. 

It's still not perfect and has some bugs and security issues. But I won't put more time and effort into it. However, if you find this project interesting and would like to contribute to its improvement, I would be thrilled to receive contributions or pull requests. Feel free to suggest enhancements, report issues, or contribute code.
